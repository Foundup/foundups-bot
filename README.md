## ❓ Why Foundups Bot?

Livestreams today face serious challenges:

- **Toxicity and spam** flood chats, overwhelming creators and viewers alike.  
- **Disinformation and low-effort trolling** go unchecked, degrading the community experience.  
- **Audience engagement** is shallow—users feel invisible, and interactions don’t evolve.

**Foundups Bot solves this.**

- It behaves like a real co-host—greeting users, remembering past conversations, and asking thoughtful follow-ups.  
- It pushes back respectfully against weak arguments, misinformation, and trolling—making streams smarter, not louder.  
- It rewards participation with crypto tokens, giving viewers real ownership and incentives to contribute meaningfully.

This isn’t just another chatbot. It’s the start of a new kind of digital public square—autonomous, intelligent, and people-powered.

# Foundups Bot — Built with Windsurf

**Foundups Bot** is a real-time conversational AI designed for YouTube livestreams. It engages users like a human, remembers them, challenges disinformation, and rewards participation through blockchain integration. This project is developed using the **Windsurf Protocol**—a modular, open, AI-augmented framework designed for building autonomous, ethical, and tokenized systems.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

1. **Proof of Concept:** Bot logs into its YouTube channel, detects livestream, joins chat, says hi, and logs messages.
2. **Prototype:** Bot remembers users, responds in real-time, flags misinformation, and behaves like a real co-host.
3. **MVP Release:** Plug-and-play solution for other YouTubers. Includes token rewards, full AI customization, and blockchain identity.

## 🧠 Windsurf Protocol Principles

This project strictly follows the Windsurf meta-framework defined in `coding_rules.json`, which outlines:

- Modular design and single responsibility
- AI and blockchain integration hooks
- Dockerized deployment
- Vector database support for RAG and memory
- Secure, ethical, and scalable system architecture
- Agent autonomy and human-in-the-loop controls

Alright folks, here's what we're building:

We're creating **Foundups Bot**—an intelligent, real-time AI that joins YouTube livestreams like a co-host. It watches the chat, remembers what people say, follows up with them like a real person, and even challenges misinformation or toxic behavior with logic and respect.

This bot isn't just smart—it rewards users. Every time someone interacts with the livestream, they earn tokens that are backed by Bitcoin. The bot creates a wallet for each participant, giving value to your attention and engagement.

It's modular, AI-agnostic, and built with blockchain from the ground up. And yes—it's fully containerized and follows strict coding rules so anyone can help build it, test it, or spin up their own.

This isn't just a chatbot. It's the future of community-driven livestreaming—powered by AI, governed by code, and owned by the people who use it.
